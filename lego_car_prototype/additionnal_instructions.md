# Additional instructions - for building the lego car prototype

This completes the building instructions provided via LDD, whith the necessary
steps to add the missing parts, in the block set of the program and the non lego
parts.

The names of the parts are *written like that*. The names used are taken from
LDD when the part is referenced and from the [bricklink][bricklink] website if
not. In the latter case, the link to the part is given.

## Front Servo

The front wheel servo must be insert in it's holder between the steps 13 and 14,
from the LDD building instructions. It's stem must be at the upper left. It's
body must be blocked between the two *connector peg/cross axle* parts added at
step 18 and it's wire can be blocked under the 1x4 technic brick added at step
14.

## Front wheels

The front wheels are attached to pieces which were once quite commons in lego
sets but which now seem to have disappeared. Here are the additional
instructions for how to attach the front wheels:  

1. In the lego plan for the chassis, built with LDD, the 4 yellow parts must be
   replaced with 2 [*1x4 plates with toothed ends*][plate-1x4-toothed-ends].  
   At each side, a [*steering arm*][steering-arm] must be inserted between the
   two previously attached plates.

2. In each steering arm, insert a *connector peg/cross axle*, the cross being
   directed downwards.

3. Link the two steering arms with a [*1x10 plate with toothed
   ends*][plate-1x10-toothed-ends], the steering trapeze is now complete
   ![front wheels - step 3](additional_inscructions-images/front-wheels-3.jpg)
4. Insert, at both external sides of the steering arms, a *connector peg*, on
   wich you can place the front wheels.  
   ![front wheels - step 4](additional_inscructions-images/front-wheels-4.jpg)
   Note that the type of front wheels you use is not important, provided they
   are of sufficient height.
5. At last, use an unfolded paper clip to assemble the servo's arm with one of
   the vertical *connector peg/cross axle*s of a *steering arm*.

## Motors

1. Place the [motor][electric-motor-4.5V] for the right rear wheel at the end of
   the chassis, with a *GEAR WHEEL T=8, M=1* on it's stem, directed to the
   right.
2. The second motor must be placed as near as possible to the first one,
   directed to the left, with a gear on it's stem too.
3. One can add a 4x6 plate above to increase the overall robustness of the
   assembly.
4. At last, one can plug two [*battery cables*][4.5V-motor-battery-cables] to
   power the motors. Screws allow to replace the wires from the plugs.
