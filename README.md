# Mechanical and hardware parts models for the carino project

## Overview

This git repository contains all the models and building instructions for making
the vehicles for the carino project. As of writing, only instructions for
building a lego car prototype are available. Work is ongoing to provide a 3D
printable model for this car.

## Software used

The lego instructions have been created with the [Lego Digital Designer][ldd]
program, which is non free (sorry...).  
3D models are built with [blender][blender].
